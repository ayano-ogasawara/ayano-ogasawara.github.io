                <h2>My journey towards User Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    Like many, I have discovered and experimented a lot with the tools that came along with the digital age!
                    I wrote my first website when I was 10 and when IE was cool, I discovered photoshop when it was still working offline and I especially enjoyed messing around with music.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After graduating university in 2012 I worked in a hostel during the day and as a DJ during the night, in Tokyo, Japan. 
                    In both jobs the customer was the main focus and I made sure to keep it that way. 
                    During my tenure the hostel business enjoyed an excellent rating across the multiple branches I helped manage / open (9 our of 10). 
                    And I was lucky enough to be able to DJ in small, medium and bigger parties in Japan and overseas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then in 2016 I decided I would have a carreer in IT. Being familiar with management thanks to my hostel experience, I became a project manager officer. 
                    There I could use my communication and presentation skills to the fullest until I moved to Berlin in 2017 and joined a startup (as a PM/PO) where I would eventually work with a UX designer that made a strong impression on me!
                    The discipline seemed to encapsulate A LOT of what I wanted to do: create, learn, challenge expectations, seek truth rather than opinions and most of all really care about the customer.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
                    So today, having some development and project management experience on top of having graduated Carreer Foundry's UX/UI Certification gives me a very strong basis on which to build upon.
